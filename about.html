        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <img src="about-image.jpg" alt="My Photo">
        <p>Welcome to The Kusanali, a small blog where I share my thought and moments of my life, and of course, I'm
            Kusanali, a lazy boy just come back from my
            uni's
            national-defense training cource. Nahide helped me a lot in managing this blog when I just played sports,
            games and slept during the course. Now she
            is having a rest and I will tell u a little about myself.</p>
        <p>Hmm...What should I begin with? Oops, I forget to tell my real name. I'm Dung, a lazy freshman Computer
            Science major
            in Hanoi University Of
            Science - Vietnam National University. During my high school time my friends called me Dun or Sweet but now
            I only keep these names in my memory.</p>
        <p>About my interest with coding, I was very curious about how people create a game or website so I follow HUS's
            Computer Science.Back to the past, I live in a moutainous area so having access to computers is a very
            luxurious desire. I also began first code lines by C++ on my phone but it seemed to be very inconvinient. I
            decided to buy a laptop after I had graduated from high school and it took me more than 1 months to get used
            to it. School teached Java first, but it didn't take me much time to understand basics. I hated Maths before
            but it seemed that if I don't try hard at Maths, my coding will be less stable and lack of logics.
            And finally, I ended my first year with 2 project built only by Java and both of them are about games. I'm
            not good at coding interface so my project just stopped with stable terminal running test and display simple
            interfaces.
        </p>
        <P>But my life isn't just about coding. Badminton and volleyball are my forte. I also play many games in my
            spare time such as Arena Of Valor, Honor Of Kings, Honkai Star Rail and Genshin Impact. "You like Genshin
            most because of me :3 but I don't like u" Nahida said. Although she is only a virtual game character but she
            helps me a lot to overcome my dark time in high school. And as a result from my playing games, I'm
            interested in learning English and Chinese</p>
        <p>Nah, I still have many things to tell u but when I was coding and writing this small corner was 1 AM and I
            must take a short sleep :((</p>
        <p>I hope u will find something funny or useful about my daily life with games, sports or even my share about
            code and
            projects, and if u find out something go wrong with my code or have any suggestion for me, I'm grateful to
            you for valuable and precious advices !</p>
