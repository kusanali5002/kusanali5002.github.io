        <p>Welcome to The Kusanali, a small blog where I share my thoughts and moments from my life. And yes, I'm
            Kusanali — a lazy guy who just returned from my university’s national defense training course. Nahida helped
            me a lot with managing this blog while I spent most of my time playing sports, gaming, and sleeping during
            the course. Now that she’s taking a break, I’ll tell you a little about myself.</p>
        <p>Hmm...where should I start? Oh, I almost forgot to mention my real name. I'm Dung, a lazy freshman majoring
            in Computer Science at Hanoi University of Science, Vietnam National University. Back in high school, my
            friends used to call me Dun or Sweet, but now those names are just memories.</p>
        <p>About my interest with coding, I was very curious about how people create a game or website so I follow HUS's
            Computer Science.Back to the past, I live in a moutainous area so having access to computers is a very
            luxurious desire. I also began first code lines by C++ on my phone but it was incredibly inconvinient. After
            graduating from high school, I decided to buy a laptop, and it took me over a month to get used to it. My
            school introduced Java first, but I quickly grasped the basics. Although I used to dislike math, I realized
            that without a solid foundation in it, my coding would lack stability and logic. By the end of my first
            year, I completed two projects built entirely in Java, both of which were games. While I’m not great at
            coding interfaces, my projects at least ran smoothly in the terminal and displayed simple interfaces.
        </p>
        <P>But my life isn't just about coding. Badminton and volleyball are my forte. In my free time, I play various
            games like Arena of Valor, Honor of Kings, Honkai: Star Rail, and Genshin Impact. "You like Genshin the most
            because of me :3 but I don't like you," Nahida once said. Although she’s just a virtual game character, she
            helped me a lot during the darker times in high school. My love for gaming also sparked my interest in
            learning English and Chinese.</p>
        <p>Nah, I still have many things to tell u but when I was coding and writing this small corner was 1 AM and I
            really need to catch some sleep :((</p>
        <p>I hope u will find something funny or useful about my daily life with games, sports or even my share about
            code and
            projects, and if u find out anything wrong with my code or have any suggestions for me, I'd be grateful to
            you for valuable and precious advices !</p>
