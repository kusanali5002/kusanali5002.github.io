            <p class="caption">VNU National-Defense Training Center overview from above.</p>
            <p class="description">This center is located in Hoa Lac, a rural area of Hanoi, and he had to travel to
                that fuckin place to complete his course. He woke up at 4 AM to prepare and get ready to leave his
                hostel. However, something went wrong with his phone at that time: he had forgotten to charge it! With
                only 4% battery remaining, he didn’t have enough time to recharge it. He arrived at the university at 5
                AM and followed the school bus to the center.</p>
            <p class="description">His mind was in chaos as he worried about living in a new place for over a month and
                how he would make friends in a small room shared with 13 people, so he remained silent on the bus. He
                was also anxious about the results of his upcoming course.</p>

            <p class="caption">His room (what fuckin board?)</p>
            <p class="description">Ok now is his room. His room was a small, cramped space numbered 323, with a poorly
                hung number board above the front door and beds squeezed in for 14 people (wtf). As he entered that
                room, he was shocked because he
                thought that
                there were ceiling fans in the room, but in reality it was just 2 mini fans hanging on ceiling.
            </p>
            <p class="description">He quickly claimed a comfortable bed for himself, ignoring the others who were
                competing for a spot to sleep. Lying in bed, he worried about how he would make friends, but
                fortunately, he was in room 323, where everyone turned out to be cheerful and friendly.</p>
            <p class="description"> At the center, students were taught politics and basic military skills. They also
                had to complete daily tasks. Students had to wake up at 5:30 AM to do morning exercises, followed by a
                quick breakfast before cleaning their rooms and heading to class at 7 AM. Lunch was served at either 10
                AM or 11 AM, followed by a nap from 11:30 AM to 1:30 PM, before returning to class at 2 PM. Dinner began
                at 5 PM or 6 PM, and from 7 PM to 8:30 PM, there was study time. They would gather in teams for a roll
                call at 8:45 PM, and the day would end when they went to bed at 9:30 PM.</p>

        <div class="content">
            <p>"To be honest, I feel lucky when living with those friends during the course. I'm so lowkey as you
                said but they changed me from a timid boy to a more active person" Dung said to me. He also want to
                introduce 14 friends who lived with him during that course...</p>

            <p class="caption">Bui Xuan Chung</p>
            <p class="description"> He was one of the most active people in Dung's room, quickly becoming the platoon
                commander within the first few days. However, due to some trivial reason, he was relieved of his
                position. Initially, he was furious with the company commander's decision, but his mood lifted, and he
                was happy again within a day. He has a strong passion for football and also possesses impressive talent
                in chess.

            <p class="caption">Le Kha Dung(left)</p>
            <p class="description">His first impression of him was his extremely quiet personality. He spent all his
                spare time sleeping and rarely interacted with others. After three weeks, he revealed that he had
                achieved a Black rank in Vovinam seven years ago, which surprised everyone. At that moment, Dung
                couldn’t help but wonder what would happen if someone in the room ever turned against Kha Dung. He also
                enjoys playing Free Fire—a popular game in his country.

            <p class="caption">Vu Thanh Cong</p>
            <p class="description"> To this day, Dung still feels that he owes Cong an apology for mistakenly thinking
                he was gay when they first met. Cong graduated from Le Hong Phong High School for gifted students, a
                renowned school in their country. Like Dung, he enjoys playing Arena of Valor, but he’s a fan of SGP, a
                rival team to FPT. He also plays Rise of Kingdoms and occasionally even earns money from the game.

            <p class="caption">Bui Quang Chien (right)</p>
            <p class="description"> Dung discovered that Chien's brain is divided to 2 parts : one for Data Structure
                and
                Algorithm
                and the other for his porn videos on X (Twitter). He is very talented in Chess and Xiangqi. About game,
                Dung
                knew that Chien likes League Of Legends.

            <p class="caption">Dao Ngoc Cuong</p>
            <p class="description"> Dung and Cuong both come from the same hometown - Thanh Hoa. Dung heard that he
                ended his
                first year with high GPA and he respected Cuong very much. He loves Fifai Online - a popular football
                game in the world. He also
                actively participated in teasing Ricons. There's a small problem that Dung has wondered about: sometimes
                Cuong sticks his hand in his pants and scratches his balls.
