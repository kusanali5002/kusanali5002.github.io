            <p class="caption">VNU National-Defense Training Center overview from above.</p>
            <p class="description">This center is located in Hoa Lac - a rural area of Ha Noi and he had to go to that
                fuckin place to finish his course. He woke up at 4 AM to prepare and get ready for going out of his
                hostle. But something went wrong with his phone at that time : He forgot charging it! Energy remained
                was 4% and he didn't have enough time to charge it. He arrived at uni at 5 AM and follow school bus to
                that center.</p>
            <p class="description">His mind at that time was chaotic when he worried about his life in a new place for
                more than 1 month and how to make friends in a small room with 13 people, so he kept silent on the bus.
                He was also nervous about his upcoming course results</p>

            <p class="caption">His room (what fuckin board?)</p>
            <p class="description">Ok now is his room. A small room numbered 323 with a slipshod number board hung above
                the front-door with beds enough for 14 people (wtf). As he entered that room, he was shocked because he
                thought that
                there were ceiling fans in the room, but in reality it was just 2 mini fans hanging on ceiling.
            </p>
            <p class="description">He immediately picked for him a comfortabe bed for him and ignored other people in
                the room who competing for a space to sleep. He lay in bed for a while and was worried about how to make
                friends, but luckily he was in room 323, everyone was very happy and friendly.</p>
            <p class="description"> In that center, students will be teached politics and basic military skills. They
                also have to carry out the daily tasks. Student have to wake up at 5.30 AM to do morning exercises and
                have fast breakfast before cleaning room and go to class at 7 AM. They will have lunch at 10 AM or 11
                AM, have a nice sleep from 11.30 AM to 1.30 PM and come back to class at 2 PM. Dinner starts at 5 PM or
                6 PM and from 7 PM to 8.30 PM is study time.They will rally in teams and check the numbers at 8.45 PM
                and end one day when they go to sleep at 9.30 PM.</p>

        <div class="content">
            <p>To be honest, I feel luckily when living with those friends during the course. I'm so lowkey as Nahida
                said but they changed me from a timid boy to a more active person...</p>

            <p class="caption">Bui Xuan Chung</p>
            <p class="description"> He is one of the most active person in Dung's room. Became platoon commander from
                first
                days but for some silly reason, he was relieved from his position. At first, he was so angry by the
                company commander's decision but he became happy again within a day. He likes football very much, and he
                also has great chess talent.

            <p class="caption">Le Kha Dung(left)</p>
            <p class="description">His first impression of him was his super quiet personality. He spends all his spare
                time to sleep and rarely interacts with other people. After 3 weeks, he leaked that he achieved Black
                rank in
                Vovinam 7 years ago and it made them all suprised. At that time Dung was still wondering what would
                happen if someone in that room turned against Kha Dung. He
                likes playing Free Fire - a popular game in his
                country.

            <p class="caption">Vu Thanh Cong</p>
            <p class="description"> Until now Dung still owes Cong an apology because he thought that Cong was gay the
                first time they met. He graduated from School for gifted students - Le Hong Phong - a famous high school
                in his country. He likes Arena Of Valor, the same as Dung but he is a SGP fan ,a rival of FPT. He also
                plays Rise Of Kingdom and sometimes he even makes money from this game.

            <p class="caption">Bui Quang Chien (right)</p>
            <p class="description"> Dung discovered that Chien's brain is divided to 2 parts : one for Data Structure
                and
                Algorithm
                and one for his porn videos on X (Twitter). He is very talented in Chess and Xiangqi. About game, Dung
                knew that Chien likes League Of Legends.

            <p class="caption">Dao Ngoc Cuong</p>
            <p class="description"> Dung and Cuong are from the same homeland - Thanh Hoa. Dung heard that he ended his
                first year with high GPA and he respected Cuong very much. He loves Fifai Online - a popular football
                game in the world. He also
                actively participated in teasing Ricons. There's a small problem that Dung has wondered about: sometimes
                Cuong sticks his hand in his pants and scratches his balls.
