        <h1>Dung's difficult journey to achieve rank Grandmaster in Honor Of Kings</h1>
        <img src="post1-image.jpg" alt="Post 1 Image" class="post-image">
        <p>The Kusanali, he joined Hero Gorge in Honor Of Kings last year but his study plans and other reasons
            prevented him from trying hard in ranked matchs. This game is the origin of Arena Of Valor, a popular game
            in his country so many heroes ands skills are very similar. But difficulties in this game is language and
            heroes stats. Unfortunately, Dung doesn't know anything about Chinese. He can't understand items' effects
            to use them properly in combat, he also has difficulty when communicate with allies because most of them are
            Chinese. Besides, heroes stats took him a lot of time to adapt. Unlike Arena Of Valor with more balance
            stats aand items, the fuckin development of this game give Maskmans average only over 3000 HP at the
            beginning so at least one defense item is compulsory for basic survival in combat. Defense items in Honor Of
            Kings still give player bonus ATK but their effects are not suitable for damage dealer. As a result, Fighter
            and Tanker
            in this game is a hot-meta. He's good at Maskmans in AOV but in HOK he had to try so hard to keep sight,
            move, attack and retreat because support items branch don't have immune crowd control ability.</p>
        <p>The new ranked season arrived at the same time with his national-defense training course so he didn't have
            many
            times to play. Besides the goal as achieve rank Grandmaster, he also tried hard for increasing his Marco
            Polo's Point because he lost the Top World 5% Title last month. His road from Master IV to Master I was very
            easy
            but in 3 last stars to get Grandmaster, he fell down again to Master II. Chinese players are so skillful and
            actually, he isn't good enough to fight against them. But he didn't give up ! With his strongest hero he
            could play - Marco Polo, he picked him in every chance he had and went straight from Master I 3 stars to
            Grandmaster 4 stars. He was so happy with that result and on the next Monday, he was informed that he
            obtained Top World 5 % Marco Polo Title again! Incredible!
        </p>
        <p>After achieve rank Grandmaster, he decided to paticipate in Peak Tournament - a special mode only for rank
            Grandmaster and above. It is extremely hard battlefield when almost who take part in a match have 1% Title
            or even Top 100 World. He just only played 7 match in this mode and fail 5. With that result, he knew that
            his ability is limited and so he accepted and now he is satisfied with current ranking.
