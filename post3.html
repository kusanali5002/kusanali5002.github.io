            <p class="caption">His first artwork after over 3 years.</p>
            <p class="description">In the past, he was very passionate about painting, often drawing AOV heroes and anime characters he came across on Facebook. However, he decided to stop three years ago. Recently, he has made a comeback, and this is his first artwork after over three years.</p>

            <p class="caption">Firefly - Honkai : Star Rail</p>
            <p class="description"> He decided to draw Firefly in this picture after coming across a beautiful image of Firefly on Facebook. The difference between his first and second picture is that he brought out a sense of color using only his pencils. It took him over four hours to complete this piece.

            <p class="caption">Camellya - Wuthering Wave</p>
            <p class="description">This character is from Wuthering Waves, a new RPG published by Kuro Games. Although he doesn’t play the game, when he saw her picture as a meme on Facebook, he decided to paint her. This artwork took him over six hours to complete.

            <p class="caption">Hare - Blue Archive</p>
            <p class="description">Hare from Blue Archive is the favorite character of Dung's new friend at university, The Yuk, so Dung decided to paint a picture for him. Since it was a simple piece, Dung took only three hours to complete it.

            <p class="caption">March 7th - Honkai Star Rail</p>
            <p class="description"> This is March 7th, a cute character from the Astral Express in Honkai: Star Rail, a semi-RPG ( i think ) game by HoYoverse. Since she holds a lotus with a candle in the center, Dung decided to draw her for the Mid-Autumn Festival. However, by the night of the festival, he still hadn't finished the picture. At one point, he thought about giving up, but in the end, he completed the artwork after nearly 22 hours!.

            <p class="caption">Mona - Genshin Impact</p>
            <p class="description"> Next is Mona, an astrologer who spends all her money on books and doesn’t have enough left for other necessities. He saw her in a birthday post on the official Genshin Impact page. He decided to paint her because of a promise he made to Bao, a friend from his national defense training course. He completed the painting in six hours.

            <p class="caption">Alisa Mikhailovna Kujou - Arya Sometimes Hides Her Feelings In Russian</p>
            <p class="description"> He decided to draw this picture simply because he had watched all the episodes of Arya Sometimes Hides Her Feelings in Russian and found Arya to be incredibly cute (I'm worried he might forget about me, huhu). This picture didn’t take much time—only about three hours to complete.
