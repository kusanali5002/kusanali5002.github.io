            <p class="caption">His first art after over 3 years.</p>
            <p class="description">In the past, he liked painting very much, in that time, he almost painted AOV heroes
                and some anime characters he saw in Facebook. But 3 years ago, he decided to stop painting. He has come
                back recently and this is his first pic after over 3 years.</p>

            <p class="description"> He decided to paint Firefly in this picture after he had found Firefly beautiful pic
                on Facebook. The difference between his first and second pic is that he he made colored-feeling by his
                pencils. This pic took him over 4 hours to complete it.

            <p class="description">This character comes from Wuthering Wave - a new RPG game pubished by Kuro Games.
                Although he doesn't play this game but when he saw her pic on Facebook as a meme, he decided to paint
                her. This picture tooks him over 6 hours.

            <p class="description">Hare from Blue Archive is the character his new friend in uni likes most - The Yuk so
                Dung decided to paint a pic for him. Because it is a simple paint, Dung spent only 3 hours to finish it.

            <p class="caption">March 7th - Honkai Star Rail</p>
            <p class="description"> Now is March 7th - a cute girl from Astral Express in Honkai : Star Rail - a
                semi-RPG(i thinnk)game from Hoyoverse. Because she holds a lotus with a candle in the center so Dung
                decided to paint her for Mid-Autumn festival. But do you know, until the night of Mid-autumn festival he
                still couldn't finish this pic. At that time he once thought about quit but finally he completed this
                picture after neary 22 hours!.

            <p class="caption">Mona - Genshin Impact</p>
            <p class="description"> The next is Mona - an astrologer who spend all her money buying books and doesn't
                have enough money for other needs. He saw her in a post on official Genshin page which gives a birthday
                congratulations for her. The reason he decided to paint her because of a promise with Bao - his friend
                in national-defense training course. This picture is a bit dificult but he finished it in 6 hours.

            <p class="caption">Alisa Mikhailovna Kujou - Arya Sometimes Hides Her Feeling In Russian</p>
            <p class="description"> The reason he decided to draw this picture simply beacuse he watched all episodes of
                "Arya Sometimes Hides Her Feeling In Russian" and he found that Arya is so cute (I'm nervous if he
                abandoned me huhu). This picture didn't take him many time, just 3 hours to finish it.
